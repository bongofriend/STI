  abstract = {Nowadays, software engineers have a great tendency to use design patterns (DPs) because they are considered to have an important role in software engineering in the sense that they can make the understanding of nonentities easier. However, most of the systems have no document helping engineers recognize DPs from the codes. As a result, different approaches for design pattern detection have been suggested. The current paper reviews different available literature on design pattern detection and reports a number of different aspects of them such as data representation, type of design pattern, advantages and disadvantages for different approaches, quantitative results, etc. The current paper reviews research studies published between 2008 until 2019 and represents a list of datasets used for evaluations. The present investigation paper is not only to lay the ground for the selection of the optimal design patterns, but also hopes to guide the future studies through raising awareness about the potential defects in the previous researches.},

  abstract = {Design patterns represent high-level recurring abstractions that reflect the know-how of experts. Their detection is a key task in the context of software engineering; it is very useful in program comprehension, design recovery and also for re-documenting object-oriented systems. Despite their usefulness, current design pattern detection approaches have a high time complexity that hinders their application. This complexity is further aggravated with the absence of guiding principles in determining which pattern to look for first among the various patterns. To overcome this practical limit, we propose to optimize any pattern detection approach by foregoing it by a filtering phase that detects possible existence of patterns and that orders the candidate patterns in terms of their degree of resemblance to the analyzed design fragments. The herein proposed filtering approach exploits semantic and structural design metrics to look for the semantic and structural symptoms of design pattern instances. Its performance is experimentally demonstrated through our design pattern detection method MAPeD (Multi-phase Approach for Pattern Discovery) applied on the open source system JUnit.},

  abstract  = {Development of desired software in the present day scenario is becoming too much complex as the user requirements becoming complex day-by-day. Hence there is a need for developing the right methodology for solving complex problem. To solve various problems in design phase, a number of tools and techniques are available and one of them is known as the use of design pattern, which helps to find a better solution for the problems, which are recurring in nature. It is often desired to detect design patterns from the source code of similar category of software, as it improves maintainability of source code of a software. In this study, mining of design pattern technique has been presented, which is based on supervised learning techniques as well as software metrics. During the pattern mining process, metrics-based dataset is developed. Subsequently, machine learning techniques such as Layer Recurrent Neural Network and Random Forest are applied for the pattern mining process. For the critical examination of the proposed study, data from an open source software e.g., JUnit is considered for the mining of software patterns.},
